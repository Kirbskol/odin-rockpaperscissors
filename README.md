# odin-rockpaperscissors

This relates to the third project of The Odin Project, which is also the first within the Javascript Foundations Course.

The game is fully played within the console.log, as per the specifications of the project.

For this project I have been tasked to create a game of rock paper scissors, which lasts five rounds, and obtains input from the user
as well as generates a random hand for the CPU each round. A scoreboard tracker is implented to track the scores after each round, and ultimately
a winner is announced or a tie game.
