# odin-rockpaperscissors

This relates to the third project of The Odin Project, which is also the first within the Javascript Foundations Course.

For this project I will initially be creating the game Rock Paper Scissors, whereby the user will play against the computer.
This game will be run entirely through the console.log function.
