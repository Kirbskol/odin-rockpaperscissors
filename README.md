This relates to the third project of The Odin Project, which is also the first within the Javascript Foundations Course. Please note, this is my first time using Javascript, so I hope it's okay!

Initially this game was built to be played entirely with console.log however I have now just finished the UI for the game.

This includes:

Start Screen where user will input their name.
Game Screen, where users will select their hand and the game logic will run.
Result Screen, where winner of each round is announced, and eventually... winner of the match!
